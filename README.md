# **Power BI Healthcare Analysis Project**

## **Overview**
This project is a comprehensive data analysis and visualization of healthcare inpatient and outpatient services. It leverages **Power BI** to provide insights into Medicare discharges, payments, and service utilization patterns across the United States for the year 2022.

## **Objective**
The primary goal of this project is to:
- Analyze and compare **inpatient (IP)** and **outpatient (OP)** services.
- Identify trends in **Medicare payments**, **discharges**, and **service utilization**.
- Provide actionable insights for decision-making in the healthcare sector.

## **Key Features**
1. **Interactive Dashboard**:
   - Total inpatient and outpatient discharges and payments.
   - Geographic distribution of healthcare services.
   - Top 10 services utilized by inpatient and outpatient groups.
   - State-wise comparisons of discharges and payments.

2. **Visualizations**:
   - **Key Metrics Summary**: Displays total discharges and Medicare payments for IP and OP services.
   - **Bar Charts**: Highlights state-wise and provider-wise discharges and payments.
   - **Stacked Area Chart**: Illustrates cumulative Medicare payments by state.
   - **Top 10 Services Chart**: Compares the most frequently utilized services by IP and OP groups.
   - **Geographic Map**: Visualizes provider locations and service volumes across the U.S.
   - **Interactive Slicers**: Allows filtering by state, service type, and provider.

## **Dataset**
The project uses **Medicare Inpatient and Outpatient Datasets** sourced from [CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services)](https://data.cms.gov/). The datasets include:
- Provider information (e.g., name, state, city).
- Service details (e.g., service type, DRG/APC descriptions).
- Financial metrics (e.g., Medicare payments, charges).
- Operational metrics (e.g., discharges, beneficiary counts).

## **Tools Used**
- **Power BI**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **Microsoft Excel**: For initial data cleaning and structuring.

## **Insights**
1. **Florida**, **California**, and **New York** have the highest Medicare discharges for both inpatient and outpatient services.
2. **Septicemia** and **heart failure** are the most commonly utilized inpatient services.
3. Outpatient services show significant utilization in diagnostic and pulmonary procedures.
4. Geographic trends reveal higher discharges in urban states compared to rural ones.

## **How to Open the Project**
1. Download the `.pbix` file from this repository.
2. Open the file in **Power BI Desktop**.
3. Interact with the dashboard using slicers to explore specific insights.
